I am an astrophysicist at the [University of Canterbury](http:canterbury.ac.nz).

My research is in mainly in the field of gravitational microlensing, and I am part of the KMTNet collaboration.

I have written several software packages (available from the github archive below) that may be useful to astronomers and others:

 - *pyDIA* is a modular python package for performing star detection, difference imaging and photometry on astronomical images.

 - *SingleLensFitter* is a code for fitting single-lens microlensing events with data from multiple sources. Finite source effects can be 
   included.

 - *Metropolis Now* is a general purpose adaptive step size Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The code runs multiple parallel Markov chains, 
   and proposal distributions can be based on indvidual chains or the ensemble.
